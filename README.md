# lossy-text-compressor
As we all know, there are times when we just don't need all of details - a vague outline is all that's needed. Furthermore, as anyone who has experimented with methods of lossless compression will know, lossless compression has its limits. If you are in such a situation, this is the software for you - a lossy text compressor. As with all lossy compression, this allows the user to cut out the largely unnecessary details, in order to achieve a smaller filesize. This revolutionary algorithm has been shown to consistently reduce the sizes of files by upwards of 14%, by removing the least significant bit of every byte. Whilst this software was originally intended for use on plaintext, it can technically be used on any file format, including raw binary.
